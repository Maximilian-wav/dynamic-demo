📝 Reflection & Retrospective on Dynamic Demo Project

🌟 Objective

To build a fully functional, locally running demo that showcases the Dynamic SDK, while directly addressing the customer’s concerns around NFT minting, account abstraction, authentication, and usability.

🔍 Approach & Thought Process

Clarity First:Broke down the customer’s feedback into clear, actionable deliverables to ensure focus on solving the right problems.

Iterative Delivery:Treated the project like a real product build — shipping incremental commits, resolving issues as they emerged, and iteratively improving functionality and design.

Real-World Mindset:Built a reference-quality implementation that real teams can evaluate and adopt with confidence.

⚡ Key Challenges Overcome

TypeScript & SDK typings:Navigated undocumented or partially typed methods (like getToken()) with careful research and defensive coding.

JWT Authentication:Implemented a robust backend authentication flow with proper token validation using Dynamic's public key.

UI/UX Polish:Enhanced the experience to feel welcoming and professional — with animations, gradients, status indicators, and error handling.

Full-Stack Coordination:Balanced frontend, backend, and blockchain integration to create a seamless user journey, even for devs unfamiliar with React.

🙌 Final Thoughts

This project reaffirmed why I’m so excited about Dynamic — building infrastructure that makes complex Web3 experiences accessible and delightful for both developers and end-users. I’d be thrilled to continue contributing my product thinking, technical skills, and attention to detail as part of the team.

Thanks so much for the opportunity to dive in and showcase what I can do!
